/**
 * Owns one lazily opened connection (an IMAP or POP3 store, or an SMTP transport) on behalf of a
 * session (roadmap P2.1 `ConnectionGuard`): connects on first use, drops the connection after
 * [idleTimeoutMillis] without use, reconnects transparently when the server or the network closed
 * it, and retries an operation once when the loss surfaced during the operation and the caller
 * allows a retry. A loss caused by a cancellation is never retried: [mayRetry] answers false when
 * the session thread was interrupted or the session aborted its sockets (roadmap P2.5).
 * Not thread-safe by design: a session runs on one executor thread (roadmap D15).
