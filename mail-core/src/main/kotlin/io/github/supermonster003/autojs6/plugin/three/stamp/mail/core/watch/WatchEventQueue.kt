/**
 * The events of one watch waiting for delivery to the host (roadmap D17 / B.3: the plugin never
 * blocks on a slow host). The watcher thread [offer]s, one delivery thread [take]s. When
 * [capacity] events are pending, everything pending collapses into a single `resync`
 * (`queue-overflow`) and the message that did not fit is dropped: the script fetches on its own.
 * Events other than messages (`mode`, `error`, `resync`) are kept after the collapse because
 * they are few and carry state. A `closed` event ends the queue: nothing is accepted after it and
 * [take] answers null once it went out.
