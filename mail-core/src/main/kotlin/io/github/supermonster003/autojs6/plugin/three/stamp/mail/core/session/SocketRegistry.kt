/**
 * The live sockets of one session, so that a cancellation coming from another thread can break
 * whatever the session thread is blocked on (roadmap P2.5 `cancel`): a connect, a TLS handshake,
 * a read waiting for the server, or a transfer.
 *
 * Angus Mail asks the configured `mail.<protocol>.socketFactory` for an unconnected socket and
 * then does the connect, the timeouts and the TLS layering itself (`SocketFetcher`), for implicit
 * SSL and STARTTLS alike. Tracking that plain socket underneath every connection is therefore
 * enough: closing it makes the SSL socket, the protocol reader or the writer on top of it fail
 * at once. [Socket.close] is thread-safe, so [closeAll] may run on any thread while the session
 * thread is inside an operation; the session thread then sees the loss, drops the connection and
 * reports `CANCELLED` (see `MailSession.abort`).
