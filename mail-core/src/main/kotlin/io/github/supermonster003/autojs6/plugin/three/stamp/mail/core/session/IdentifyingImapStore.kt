/**
 * An [IMAPStore] that sends the `ID` command (RFC 2971) on every connection it opens, right
 * after that connection has authenticated.
 *
 * Angus Mail keeps a small pool of connections (`mail.imap.connectionpoolsize`, default 1): the
 * connection made by `connect` serves store commands, an opened folder takes it, and a store
 * command issued while the folder holds it (`hasCapability`, `LIST`, `STATUS`, ...) opens a
 * further connection; when the folder closes, the pool keeps only as many as fit and drops the
 * rest. NetEase (163 / 126 / yeah.net) answers `NO SELECT Unsafe Login` (and the same for
 * `EXAMINE`) on any connection that has not identified itself, so [IMAPStore.id] on the first
 * connection alone is not enough: on 2026-09-18 the second connection (tag prefix `B`) failed
 * exactly like that after the first one had identified itself and had then been dropped.
 *
 * An empty [clientId] means "never send ID"; servers that do not advertise the `ID` capability
 * are left alone. The answer of the first identified connection is kept as [serverId].
