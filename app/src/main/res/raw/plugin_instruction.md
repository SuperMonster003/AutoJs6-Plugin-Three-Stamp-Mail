Angus Mail gives AutoJs6 scripts a global `mail` object for sending messages, listing and searching mailboxes, reading bodies, downloading attachments, managing flags and folders, and watching a folder for new mail. It is built on [Eclipse Angus Mail](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/angus-mail/) 2.0.5, the reference implementation of Jakarta Mail, and speaks IMAP, POP3, and SMTP over TLS.

Version 1.3.0 adds the browser sign-in for Google and Microsoft accounts (roadmap P9) on top of the background watches of 1.1.0 (roadmap P8); every item of phases P0 to P8 shipped with 1.0.0 to 1.1.0, with evidence in [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/SuperMonster003/AutoJs6-Plugin-Angus-Mail/blob/master/ROADMAP.md). Requires AutoJs6 6.8.0 (build 5282) or later; the "On mail arrived" task needs the host build with mail contract version 2; the full script API reference is in the [AutoJs6 documentation](https://docs.autojs6.com/#/mail).

### Usage

1. Install the plugin APK from [Releases](https://github.com/SuperMonster003/AutoJs6-Plugin-Angus-Mail/releases) on a device with AutoJs6 build 5282 (6.8.0) or later.
2. Open the AutoJs6 plugin center, confirm that `Angus Mail` is recognized, and enable it.
3. Prepare the account: turn on IMAP or POP3 and SMTP in the provider's web settings and obtain an authorization code (QQ, 163, 126, Sina) or an app password (Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo); the login password itself is usually not accepted. Gmail, Outlook.com and Microsoft 365 accounts can instead be signed in with the Google or Microsoft account in the browser from the plugin settings (choose "Sign in with Google / Microsoft (browser)" as the authentication), or given an OAuth 2.0 access token obtained elsewhere.
4. Call `mail.connect(...)` in a script, or save the account on the plugin's settings page (its launcher icon, or AutoJs6 developer options > Mail account settings) and connect by alias.
5. To run a script on new mail without keeping one running: add a watch on the plugin's Watches page (settings > Watches: account alias, folder, mode, filters), allow the notification when asked, then create a task in AutoJs6 (long-press the script > timed task > run on broadcast > On mail arrived) and pick the watch; the task needs an AutoJs6 build with mail contract version 2.
